# Usage
Install through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org):
```
pod 'BubbleTransition', '~> 3.2.0'

use_frameworks!
```
Install through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage):
```
github "andreamazz/BubbleTransition"
```

# Setup
Have your view controller conform to `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate`. Set the `transitionMode`, the `startingPoint`, the `bubbleColor` and the `duration`.
```swift
let transition = BubbleTransition()

public override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
  let controller = segue.destination
  controller.transitioningDelegate = self
  controller.modalPresentationCapturesStatusBarAppearance = true
  controller.modalPresentationStyle = .custom
}

// MARK: UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate

public func animationController(forPresented presented: UIViewController, presenting: UIViewController, source: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {
  transition.transitionMode = .present
  transition.startingPoint = someButton.center
  transition.bubbleColor = someButton.backgroundColor ?? .black
  return transition
}

public func animationController(forDismissed dismissed: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {
  transition.transitionMode = .dismiss
  transition.startingPoint = someButton.center
  transition.bubbleColor = someButton.backgroundColor ?? .black
  return transition
}
```

You can find the Objective-C equivalent [here](https://gist.github.com/andreamazz/9b0d6c7db065555ec0d7).

# Swipe to dismiss

You can use an interactive gesture to dismiss the presented controller. To enable this gesture, prepare the interactive transition:

```swift
let interactiveTransition = BubbleInteractiveTransition()

override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
  if let controller = segue.destination as? ModalViewController {
    controller.transitioningDelegate = self
    controller.modalPresentationStyle = .custom
    controller.modalPresentationCapturesStatusBarAppearance = true
    controller.interactiveTransition = interactiveTransition
    interactiveTransition.attach(to: controller)
  }
}
```

and implement `interactionControllerForDismissal` in your presenting controller:

```swift
func interactionControllerForDismissal(using animator: UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning) -> UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning? {
  return interactiveTransition
}
```

In the presented controller make sure to call `finish()` on the interactive gesture if you need to quickly dismiss from a button press instead. Check the sample code for more info.  

You can decide the gesture threshold and the swipe direction:
```swift
interactiveTransition.interactionThreshold = 0.5
interactionThreshold.swipeDirection = .up
```

# Properties
```swift
var startingPoint = CGPointZero
```
The point that originates the bubble.

```swift
var duration = 0.5
```
The transition duration.

```swift
var transitionMode: BubbleTranisionMode = .present
```
The transition direction. Either `.present`, `.dismiss` or `.pop`.

```swift
var bubbleColor: UIColor = .white
```
The color of the bubble. Make sure that it matches the destination controller's background color.
